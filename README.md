# Background 
We're curious: why do crypto degens only buy and sell tokens in the market? Why not buy a coffee? Because no coffee supports this: Crypto Coin buys Crypto Coffee. Let’s DO it! How to use it? Download a test version app, and create your account. Get your test ERC20 token(Test USDT token) from the faucet or our builders. A: you are the boss, create an item QR and show it to me. B: I’m the customer, use the app scan your QR, (input the number) check the payment number, and verify my fingerprint, paid! A: You can check your balance in your app account, give me coffee, and keep coins! Anyone can create any items to sell to anyone, that is all. B: Having a cup of coffee is so enjoyable!

# Tech stack
We build it depending on ERC4337 and Paymaster for a gasless user experience. We create a contract account for programming the ERC20 tokens to buy something. We use Push Protocol to notify the boss to check the incoming tokens. We use your fingerprint or Face ID as a passkey to register your account and encrypt your transactions.
